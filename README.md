The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications.  It gives user the ability to control more than one digital thing easily through a comfortable GUI over the wireless media.. This research paper is based on the concepts of wireless media, where in an unauthorized or unwanted intrusion or motion is detected using different hardware and software tools. This paper makes the use of an Arduino Uno board, which forms the basis of this wireless research. To the Arduino, an PIR sensor that detects the movement of a person is used in unison. This will be used to send and receive video.  A video would be transmit to the receiver whenever an unwanted movement is detected by the sensor. On detection of an unauthorised movement, In addition to this, an effort would be made to use a Wireless module also. This Wireless module is used to connect to the wireless in order to send and receive the data. Then it is displayed on LCD TV (television).
